         <h1 class="title">Postpartum Depression Symptoms, Causes & Treatment</h1>
          <div class="post-content"><h2>Up to 75% of postpartum women have some degree of the baby blues, and 15% of women experience depression.</h2>

              <p>Although having a baby brings many positive things to one’s life, it also requires a lot of adjustments in the way we see the world, our priorities, how we spend our time, and the energy we can put into other areas of our lives. 
              The postpartum period is a time of significant disruption in sleep, nutrition, and exercise.
              One of the many mental problems that is frequently believed to be related to the postpartum blues is postpartum depression (PPD). Only the timing of depressive episodes, according to many clinicians,
              distinguishes postpartum depression from other types of depression. Within four weeks of giving birth, it begins, and any large or mild depressed episode, for that matter, characterises it.
              This bio-psycho-social phenomenon is influenced by a number of elements. In addition, many psychologists believe that PPD is not a mental condition that is innate to delivery, 
              unlike other mental disorders. Instead, it is something that develops from an underlying problem.</p>

            <p><h1>What causes postpartum depression?</h1>
              Many new mothers experience mood swings, worry, and tearfulness in the first few weeks postpartum.  This is often called the “baby blues”, and is likely related both to biological factors (hormonal shifts as the body changes from a pregnant to postpartum state) as well as psychological factors (adjustment to being a parent and the responsibilities of caring for a newborn, which is a major life event).  It is a normal part of postpartum adjustment, resolves on its own, and does not require any intervention.  Support and reassurance from family and friends is very helpful.  Up to 75% of postpartum women have some degree of the baby blues. 
              Although the baby blues is part of normal adjustment and resolves on its own, some women experience symptoms that are more severe and persistent.
              Even though all the possible causes of postpartum depression have not been outlined yet, some clinical studies were able to pinpoint some of its probable causes. 
              These events could make some women more susceptible to this illness than other women.<br>
              Hormonal changes are probably the number one reason why mothers experience this psychological illness. 
              Due to rapid hormonal changes, while giving birth, women could become more sensitive to those changes and get depressed.
              Research also shows that mothers with postpartum depression experience large drops in their thyroid hormone levels. 
              This leads to postnatal hyperthyroidism, which could contribute to a mother’s susceptibility to postpartum depression. 
              Lastly, women who do fail to meet their expectations after giving birth also experience this illness. Depression occurs when they start feeling frustrated about the added stress of taking care of a baby, lack of sleep, and changes in the family.</p>

            <p>
              <h1>Factors Contributing to Gravity of it</h1>
              In general, women who have a history of mental illnesses are more vulnerable to developing postpartum depression. 
              Additionally, there are other conditions that favour its occurrence:

                As long as moms and their spouses are aware of its symptoms, the baby blues are simple to see. 
                Significant alterations in the mother's food and sleeping patterns, irrational rage, diminished libido, and even weariness are some of its typical symptoms. 
                The most noticeable sign of it is when a mother begins to feel bad and depressed after giving birth for no apparent cause.

              <h1>Postpartum depression treatment</h1>
              The good news is that help is available.  It is important for those affected by perinatal mental illness to know that they do not need to continue suffering, and it is not their 
              fault that they feel this way.  All perinatal mental illnesses are treatable, and with proper care you can fully recover.The majority of therapists agree that a combination of talk therapy along with medication is frequently the most effective and 
              long-lasting treatment for mental health problems. This is so that the issue won't be covered up by medication alone. 
              To get long-term results, you must identify the cause of your problems and try to fix them. With the aid of medication, 
              it is frequently simpler to muster the inspiration and bravery to start on this path.

                Treatment can include:

                <ul>

                </ul>
              </p>
            </div>
                The treatment(s) you choose depends on the type of illness, how severe the symptoms are, and each individual’s beliefs and preferences. 
                Speak with your healthcare provider to find a treatment that works for you. Often, a combination of treatment options is needed and recovery 
                times will vary from individual to individual.
